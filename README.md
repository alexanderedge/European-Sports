# European Sports

A Eurosport Player client for tvOS, supporting live TV and on-demand content.

I developed this watch squash coverage on my Apple TV since Eurosport didn't have a tvOS app. [They do now](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/eurosport-player/id339708430?mt=8&uo=4&ct=github&at=10lHPc).

The application is written in Swift 3 and uses Core Data for persistents. I used Charles proxy to intercept traffic from the official iOS apps to generate the API framework. The API may change at any time.
